## stories for swimlane component

- DONE. firstly, we need a text fixture. this is plain text of some paragraphs which are tokenized into source text with some alternative (transliterated, translated) text for each token.

- DONE. secondly, we display the fixture using one lane or two lanes. using padding for the paragraph (set with flow) or just spacing between each token.

- TODO. introduce a `selection` reducer to lookup class names of items. do not store style or class names in the `paragraphs` state.
